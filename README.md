# RekordBuddy
The future-proof music collection manager, built by DJs for DJs.

This initial code dump will most likely not build easily or at all. That's normal. Still working on converting everything over and fixing things so that it does.

I'm moving my personal projects to codeberg so before too many content is created here, I've decided to move this repo too.

You can now find it at: https://codeberg.org/DidierMalenfant/RekordBuddy

Update your links, this Github version will be deleted early 2024.
